    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Faith Changes</h1>
    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      Lately I’ve been musing on alot of things. I'm consciously trying to avoid
      the words 'struggling with’ because these things make me realize areas I
      need to grow in. One big thing on my mind is staying true and grounded to
      my faith. As I grow older, I’ve realized that I had been taking a lot of
      important things for granted, and I’ve been working on being the grown
      adult I want myself to be, by being intentional about my financial,
      career, education, and life after-35 goals. These seem to be taking shape,
      but I’m struggling with actually staying grounded to my faith goals. I am
      on the lukewarm side and I detest it.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I was 15 or 16, someone (who I still can’t remember no matter how
      hard I try) once told me, as you grow older, it becomes even harder than
      you think to create time to grow within your faith. And I never showed it,
      but deep down I scoffed—a gentle scoff, of course. Because when I was
      young, things like praying, casual conversing with God, and even jisting
      were effortless. It felt like an ordinary thing, and I had thought surely
      the relationship will grow and become better as time passed. But now, as I
      sit and think of how I long for those days, I know that person was right.
      <br />
      <br />I still try to create time for God, but there’s that spiritual
      connection that is missing, and I know why it’s missing because it was
      never about the conversations or the prayers; it was about the habits that
      kept Him close. I realized that in the past, there were no distracting
      habits, just struggling to get that perfect grade, having
      good times with friends, and that
      was it. Nothing ever crossed me to the level of losing my temper and
      crying out angrily. Point is,
      there are more things that are now proving hard to navigate and with more
      of this I feel farthest from His presence. To keep my sanity, I’ve taken
      some time away from their casual conversations (maybe I’m
      delusional but yes they were conversations) to help me deal with the
      constant trials.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the past, the gentle inner voice which I had come to recognize
      distinctively, would guide me through every emotion, every action. But
      somehow, that connection has slipped away. I pray to revive it, and I know
      the how-to, but it's not happening. I fully know it is in the habits I’ve
      picked up gradually that are pushing Him away. But those very habits are
      my coping mechanisms. So, the question is—how do I learn to let them go?

    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <p>
        When I started working in Developer Relations (DevRel), I didn't know
        much about Developer Experience (DX). In fact, I wasn't familiar with
        many DevRel terms. I learned most of it on the job, gradually
        understanding the different parts of DevRel: Developer Advocacy,
        Developer Marketing, Developer Success, and Developer Experience. At
        first, I struggled to cover all these areas to meet my job goals. DevRel
        works best with a team, and doing it all alone can be tough. But over
        time, I learned more and got better at handling my tasks. While building
        a community is important in DevRel, and it feels like I should have
        started by writing on it, I've been focusing more on Developer
        Experience lately and so I felt more compelled to write about it. If
        you're interested in learning about DX, then this blog is for you.
        <br />
        <br />
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">What is Developer Experience?</h2>
        Developer Experience (DX) is about how developers interact with and feel
        about tools, APIs, or software. It's similar to User Experience (UX),
        but for developers. Good DX means the tools are easy to use and
        enjoyable, while bad DX can be frustrating and inefficient. People in
        DevRel teams work to make the developer experience positive and
        productive.

        <br />

         <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How DevRels Improve Developer Experience</h2>

      <p>
        DevRel professionals bridge the gap between organizations and the
        developer community. While focusing on DX their responsibilities include
        but is not limited to updating documentation, creating educational
        materials and maintaining open-source projects (for companies with open
        source projects.)
        <br />
        <br /> Here’s a closer look at how they achieve this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Keeping Documentation Up-to-Date:</strong> This means
          regularly updating API documentation to show new features and
          improvements. Good documentation helps developers understand how to
          use the tools and stay informed about changes.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          <strong>Creating Learning Materials:</strong> They create various
          learning materials, like guides, video tutorials, and sample projects.
          These resources help developers learn how to use tools more easily.
          For example, step-by-step guides quickly show developers how to use an
          API in their projects.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Engaging with the Community:</strong> Engaging with the
          developer community is crucial and can happen through forums, social
          media, and events. Hosting webinars, joining discussions, and
          gathering feedback, help DevRel professionals to address developers'
          challenges and improve resources in turn increasing DX.

          Improving DX in Chimoney’s API Documentation and Resources
        </h1>
        <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I mentioned earlier, I have been focusing on Developer Experience
        of late and one of my most rewarding experiences has been improving DX
        for Chimoney's API Documentation and Community projects (I'll reference
        last year's efforts). <br />
        <br />
        Here’s how I'm doing it:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Enhancing Documentation:</strong>This has been a slow but
          rewarding process. I started by thoroughly reviewing our documentation
          and studying documentation from other products. I needed all the
          insights I could get to understand what makes documentation truly
          effective. Through the events we've been having in our community and
          others I attended to talk about our open-source project, I gradually
          gathered a lot of feedback. With these feedback, I worked on the first
          iteration of the documentation update which turned out well. I
          simplified the getting started guide, ensuring that all necessary
          information was easily accessible. I also updated the glossary,
          provided clear explanations for the endpoints, introduced a changelog,
          and identified and got bugs fixed in some endpoints. These
          improvements allowed developers to find the information they needed
          quickly and easily, leading to a smoother experience.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developing Learning Materials: </strong>
          This is what I am currently working on, and it honestly requires a lot
          of patience. I had started by creating a{" "}
          <a
            href="https://chimoney.io/api-use-cases/"
            className="text-blue-500 underline"
          >
            use case page{" "}
          </a>{" "}
          that includes step-by-step integration guides to help developers
          quickly understand how to incorporate Chimoney's APIs into their
          projects using real-world examples. Currently, I am developing
          integration guides for all of our endpoints and initially
          overestimated how quickly I could complete all the content, including
          written tutorials and videos. The goal is to create a variety of
          learning materials tailored to different learning styles. These
          resources help shorten the process of understanding how exactly the
          endpoints work and how to integrate them which all ties back to
          developer experience and shortening integration times.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active Community Engagement:</strong> For this I'll reference
          last year's participation in our open source project. Events, office
          hours or just setting up a specific channel for support as developers
          integrate is very crucial. What works for me is setting up office
          hours and having one on ones when I am available to debug or solve
          issues our community contributors are facing while integrating. These
          help me get first hand feedback to continuously improve our tools and
          documentation.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encouraging Contributions:</strong> Developers most times feel
          better contributing to projects that have a collaborative environment.
          For this we ensure to provide clear guidelines for contributing to our
          open-source projects. We also make sure to be responsive to pull
          requests and issues, creating a welcoming atmosphere for new
          contributors. This has helped to improve our projects and build a
          stronger, more supportive community because of the good developer
          experience in terms of support.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        I am still learning on how to constantly improve DX in our documentation
        and resources and so this blog might not be as informative as I would
        like it to be but I will constantly update it as I work on more details
        and resources. Feel free to reach out and ask questions or give
        feedback.

    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <p>
        As someone involved in community building and developer relations, I’ve seen the amazing impact of
        open source on financial ecosystems. While I never got to present my talk at the  <a
          href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum-london/"
          className="text-blue-500 underline"
        >
          Open Source Finance Forum,{" "}
        </a>
        I still wanted to share my thoughts on how open-source readiness can empower financial communities,
        gathering from my experience at Chimoney.<br /><br />
        <strong>Understanding Open Source Readiness</strong><br />
        When I talk about open-source readiness, I’m referring to more than just the ability to use open-source
        software. It’s about creating a mindset and a culture that embraces collaboration, transparency, and
        innovation. Open source is a philosophy that, when properly understood and adopted, can create significant
        potential for any community, especially in the finance sector.
        At Chimoney, while we haven't built major features from the ground up using open source, we actively
        leverage open-source projects and tools developed by the community. For instance, we leverage SDKs and tools
        developed by open-source contributors, which enable us to streamline processes like rewarding contributors
        directly through Chimoney wallets on GitHub.<br /><br />
        <strong>How Open Source Transforms Financial Ecosystems</strong><br />
        The traditional financial industry has often been closed off, with proprietary systems and limited
        collaboration. But I’m seeing firsthand how open-source projects are changing that landscape. By opening up
        development and inviting collaboration, these projects are creating more inclusive, flexible, and innovative
        financial systems.
        At Chimoney, we’ve used the power of open source to improve our platform’s capabilities. In particular, our
        integration with Interledger (a global open protocol for payments) has allowed us to contribute to and benefit
        from a network of innovators working towards making financial transactions more accessible whilst staying true to our mission of financial inclusion.
        <br /><br /><strong>Open Source in Driving Financial Inclusion</strong><br />
        I honestly believe that open-source technologies play a part in achieving financial inclusion. In many parts of the world, access to financial services is still limited, and traditional systems often fail to reach the people who need them most. But open source can change that by providing the tools and platforms needed to build inclusive financial systems.
        At Chimoney, our focus on open-source readiness has enabled us to create solutions that cater to a wide range
        of users. We're currently improving features like our multi-currency wallets and cross-border payment services
        by integrating with Interledger’s open-source Rafiki API, making these services accessible to everyone,
        regardless of location or economic status. By leveraging open-source technologies, we can ensure that our services are not only innovative but also inclusive and equitable.
        <br /><br /><strong>Practical Ways for Embracing Open Source Readiness</strong><br />
        Here are a few strategies that I think can help others embrace open-source readiness in their
        financial communities:<br /><br />
        <strong>1. Education First:</strong> It’s important to educate your team and community about what open source
        means and how it can benefit them. Knowing the core ideas behind open source is key to success.<br /><br />
        <strong>2. Active Collaboration:</strong> Engage with existing open-source communities and contribute to
        projects that align with your goals. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of what makes open source so
        powerful.<br /><br />
        <strong>3. Invest in the Right Infrastructure:</strong> Make sure your technical infrastructure is capable of
        supporting open-source tools. This not only includes the software stack but also creating an environment that
        encourages continuous learning and improvement.<br /><br />
        <strong>4. Encourage Creativity:</strong> Allow your team the freedom to experiment with open-source tools and
        ideas. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, so it’s important to create an environment where
        creativity is encouraged.<br /><br />
        <strong>5. Focus on Inclusion:</strong> Always keep the needs of underrepresented and underserved communities
        in mind when developing open-source solutions. Financial inclusion should be a priority in any open-source
        project in the financial sector.<br /><br />
        I hope this blog inspires you to consider how you can include open-source readiness in your own work—either as a developer, community manager, or someone involved in the financial sector in any capacity.
        <br /><br />
        Until next time!

      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
        In Samburu, education often costs a girl her freedom.
        Many are forced to undergo FGM or get married off as early as seven. The teenage pregnancy rate is around 50%, the highest in Kenya.
        For many girls, childhood ends before it even begins.

        At the Samburu Girls Foundation, things are different. Girls who’ve been rescued from harmful traditions find safety, support, and a chance to go to school.
        <br /><br />

        <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" /> <br />

        A few days before visiting, we got to speak with Dr. Josephine Kulea, the founder. She’s calm and gentle, but you can tell she’s incredibly strong from how she speaks and what she’s done.

        <br /><br />

        She told us how it all started. <i>“I was invited to a wedding,”</i> she said, <i>“and later found out the bride was my cousin. She was just 10.”</i> Josephine took her to the police and rescued her.

        <br /><br />

        But the next day, the wedding still happened, the family replaced her with her 7-year-old sister. Josephine went back and rescued her too. That younger sister stayed with her and became the first girl at the foundation.

        <br /><br />

        <i>“My family cursed me. My life was at risk at times. But I didn’t care, I just wanted the girls to go to school,”</i> Josephine said.

        <br /><br />

        We later met the second girl Josephine rescued, now all grown up and a graduate. She became my friend when i went back to foundation to volunteer on-site for a short while.

        <br /><br />
        <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />
        <br />

        We had also been talking with Wanjiru, the foundation’s Executive Director, before the trip. Meeting her in person was lovely, she’s warm and full of kindness.

        <br /><br />

        <i>“I met Josephine by chance,”</i> she told us, <i>“and after visiting the foundation, I gave my one-month notice at work, packed everything, and moved to Samburu.”</i>

        <br /><br />

        Together, they’ve built a place that now sits on 15 acres. But it’s taken a lot.

        <br /><br />

        <i>“When we started, we had no land,”</i> Wanjiru shared. There was resistance, some people questioned why they were going against cultural practices. There were times morans (young Samburu men) would try to break in to take back girls. They even had to install electric fencing.

        <i>“Having guns isn’t rare here,”</i> she added.

        <br /><br />
        <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" /> <br />

        Sitting in one of the classrooms (which doubles as the ICT room), Wanjiru told us about how hard it is to get consistent funding.

        <i>“I’ve had to become a professional beggar,”</i> she said jokingly, but you could hear the struggle behind the words.

        <br /><br />

        We met Angella there, a brilliant girl who had been accepted to Kenyatta University but hadn’t joined yet because of finances.

        <i>“She’ll join eventually,”</i> Wanjiru said. <i>“Maybe with a scholarship like Rozilla.”</i> Rozilla, another alum of the foundation, now has a Mastercard Foundation scholarship to study IR at USIU. She had also been part of the team that won the

        </a>

        <br /><br />
        <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" /> <br />

        We asked how the girls end up at the center.

        <i>“Some run away. Some walk for days. Others are brought by people who care,”</i> Wanjiru said.

        Once they’re there, the foundation verifies their background with local chiefs. They always try to reconnect the girls with their families, if it’s safe.

        But it’s not always easy. Some families have taken them to court, demanding back their bride price (livestock).

        <i>“Animals are wealth in Samburu,”</i> Wanjiru explained. The foundation works closely with child protection services and lawyers.

        <i>“Somehow, we manage,”</i> she smiled.

        <br /><br />

        When the girls arrive, they go through a one-year "accelerator", a prep class that helps them learn basic reading, writing, and math before joining regular schools.

        <i>“It started as a joke,”</i> Wanjiru said, “but it really works.”

        For high school, they’re placed in schools outside Samburu, so they get to meet and interact with girls from different parts of the country.

        </div>

        <br /><br /> <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" /> <br />

        As we walked around, Wanjiru pointed out the small room she and Josephine used to sleep in, the tiny office they worked from and the wooden kitchen where meals were cooked.

        And then, the basketball court. A gift from Masai Ujiri after his visit.

        <i>“He asked the girls what they wanted,”</i> Wanjiru told us.

        <i>“They said, ‘We want to play basketball.’ So he built them a court.”</i> <br /> <br />

        At the end of our visit, we met the girls. Full of joy and energy. It’s hard to imagine what they’ve been through.

        Wanjiru asked them to sing the SGF anthem. As they sang, it hit us, this place gives them safety, a chance, and something to hold on to.

        They asked us lots of questions. So bright, so curious and we only stopped when Wanjiru had to move them along.

        <br /><br />

        The foundation needs support as many girls still don’t have access to this kind of refuge. They need help with basic things such as food, medicine, school fees.

      I’m not new to Christianity but I am new to having a relationship with God. And I consider myself still young and growing, most of the questions I have been asking myself are slowly being answered. Recently, I found myself doubting my faith. I was hanging out with a couple of friends who had the same questions I once struggled with. As I tried to share my answers with them, I realized my words didn’t resonate with them at all. At that moment, I began to question most things. I started to wonder if I was stupid for believing in God. I gave in to the doubt, slipping back into old habits I had left behind. Not necessarily harmful but that took away the time I spent in His presence.

      <br /><br />Immediately I separated from my friends I felt the weight of what I had done. I felt emptiness when I realized I couldn’t feel the holy spirit anymore. I blamed myself for not being able to answer their questions and convict them in the same way I had been convicted and also for not being strong in my faith that I could be easily swayed by a simple doubt.

      <br /><br /> <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Meaning Behind the Lyrics</h1>

      <i>“When those thoughts crowd my head and saying, maybe you’re losing your mind and failing”</i><br />

      In the time that I had left the presence of my friends, all those weighted thoughts came flooding. I began to think that maybe I was wrong to believe, that maybe I was failing as a Christian.

      <br /><br /><i>“Sounds like I’m in too deep, tracing my steps it feels so hard”</i><br />
      It felt impossible to get back to where I was spiritually. I thought I was too far gone, and that repenting would just lead me to fall back again.
      <br /><br /><i>“Coming deep is you, holding my heart where I thought I blew”</i><br />
      But in that desolate place, I felt the Holy Spirit reach out to me. He didn’t give me answers or explanations. Instead, He gently reminded me that it was okay. Where I thought I had messed up, He let me know that it is totally ok .
      <br /><br /><i>“You know that I missed you, for the short time I fell and my heart felt like a cage”</i><br />
      In that moment, I missed God’s presence. The emptiness I felt without Him made my heart feel like it was trapped in a cage. (This was also meant for humor because I did miss Him)
      <br /><br /><i>“Why, faults, conniving, ingrained and staining”</i><br />
      During the conversation I had with my friends they had asked a lot of whys, ‘Why is there bad if God’s there’ and I started questioning too and I felt like that stained me in parts I didn’t think it could

      <br /><br /><i>“Maybe we found our hope in the saying that I’m with you”</i><br />
      The only answer I had all through the experience was ‘I’m with You’ that’s God’s promise to us and it was the only thing that made sense at that time. And I think that’s what gives all other christians hope, the fact that he promised that He is with us everytime

      <br /><br />The outro emphasizes God’s promise to us that he is always there, in everything he is always there and we just have to reach out, so I hope you reach today!

    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Iterating on Developer Experience</h1>
    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      After giving my talk at PyCon Kenya 2025 on <strong>Practical Developer Experience Strategies for Python Developers</strong>, 
      I felt the need to write this follow-up. While preparing the talk, I found myself reflecting on the experience  
      I’ve had with DX and realized just how much my perspective has shifted since I first wrote about it. <br/><br/>
      When I wrote my first blog about <a
          href="https://devrel-musings.vercel.app/blog/DX"
          className=" text-blue-500 underline"
        >
          Developer Experience (DX)
        </a>, I was mostly sharing the early lessons I’d picked up, like how simplifying documentation or rewriting a guide can make such a big difference. Back then, 
      I thought those small fixes were the main win. Now, I’ve realized they’re only the starting point. <br/><br/>
      Because you can polish a getting started guide a hundred times, but the real test comes when someone 
      new actually tries it. That’s when you see the gaps you missed. That’s when the unexpected questions come in, 
      and the assumptions you didn’t even realize you’d made come up.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Iteration as a habit</h2>
     
      At first, I treated documentation updates like one-off projects, start, finish, done. But the reality is, 
      DX doesn’t really end. It loops. You publish something, someone tries it, you get feedback, and you adjust. 
      Then the cycle repeats. Sometimes the changes are big, like reorganizing navigation so developers don’t have 
      to dig for the important stuff. Other times, it’s something as small as rewriting one sentence so it finally 
      makes sense. Both matter.
      <br />
      <br />
     <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Empathy at the core</h2> 
      The longer I’ve done this, the more I see DX less as ‘content work’ and more as an empathy exercise. 
      When you do it, you need to remember what it feels like to be brand new, landing on a page, connecting 
      to an unfamiliar API, and not having the mental shortcuts the builder already has. Good DX is anticipating 
      that moment and smoothing it out before frustration sets in.

      <br />
      <br />
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The long game</h2>
    If the first stage of my experience was fixing the obvious rough edges, the next stage has been about listening 
    and adapting. And maybe that’s the real lesson, DX is never ‘done.’ It improves through the conversations, 
    the feedback loops, and the little updates that slowly change a tool from a barrier into a bridge.

        I am writing this instead of sleeping and while listening to Johannes Bornlof, and for your sake I have included the tracks so you can have the same serene and tranquil feeling I am having while writing this. Recently, I’ve been having flashbacks, a wave of nostalgia washing over me. I’ve been randomly thinking about when I first read some books; my first swahili or romance novels, my first crush, and all the overwhelming feelings I wish I could have bottled back then. Memories of home come rushing back: of my childhood friends, how I loved staying in, and how much I enjoyed reading books and finishing most in one sitting. Just recently, while going through those books, I felt every emotion I had experienced while reading them, as if no time had passed. I don’t know what’s causing this reflection, maybe it’s how distant those memories seem as each year goes by or because in a few years I’ll be in my mid twenties, can’t wait!
        <br /><br />
        2024 was unpredictable. I experienced my first heartbreak, graduated, traveled to more countries, grew closer to God, and even deepened my bond with my family. It felt like a year of tackling things I had been putting off for so long and, to my surprise, many of them worked out.
        <br /><br />
        At the beginning of the year, I added “Getting closer to God” as one of my goals for 2024. Honestly, I kept looking at that goal and thinking, This might end up being the least achieved goal on my list. But, oh boy, I was wrong, it turned out to be the goal I worked on the most this year. God really knows how to pull you closer; all you need to do is show interest :) And I’m so happy I did. It’s made me realize how far I still have to go with Him, but I’m ready to keep growing.
        <br /><br />
        When I wrote down my goal of getting closer to God, I knew I needed to find a church. I prayed about it, and in February, He led me to the church I now call home. I’ve grown so much spiritually that I can’t even put it into words. I’m grateful for the peace that comes with prayer, reading His word, and worship. I’ve struggled in the past with writing and intentionally listening to Christian songs, but this year, it became easier. I want to continue documenting this journey—the love, the lessons, and everything in between. I’m still praying for His guidance to do this not in the way I want but in the way He wills. Oh, and a big milestone for me this year: I gave my first tithe!
        <br /><br />
        I had also aimed to make a leap in my career this year, but I feel like I just did enough to get by. Honestly, though, I don’t regret it because—I graduated! The number of times I almost dropped out is uncountable, and I never thought I could actually make it. Now that I have, I wish I had never doubted myself. With graduation behind me, I can finally focus on getting my Master’s degree. I always thought I’d pursue a Master’s in Music, but this year changed my mind, and I’ll now be studying Financial Technology and I couldn’t be more excited!
        <br /><br />
        This year, I improved my songwriting skills, and I’m so proud that I was able to put my songs out there without hesitation. Though the year ended with my guitar breaking beyond repair, I’m looking forward to starting piano lessons soon! Of course it will be me teaching myself but yeah, And the next time I get a guitar, I’m going for a cool electric one. I also tried learning how to make professional indie music, but it felt overwhelming each time, so I stepped back for now. I also almost enrolled in a production class but decided against it, and I’m glad I took the time to reconsider.
        <br /><br />
        The highlight of my year was visiting more countries. I can’t wait to explore even more next year! These trips left me exhausted at times—the longest rest I had before each trip was about a week—but I loved every bit of them. The different cultures, the people, the music, the serenity, and the new experiences were all unforgettable. I made it a point to listen to a new song in each country I visited so I’d always have something to remember them by, and I’m so glad I did. The most memorable country for me was South Africa, and I’m excited to be going back soon.
        <br /><br />
        This is a jumbled up wrap up but that’s all my mind can highlight right now. I’ll make a point of doing monthly wrap ups so it’s a bit organized the next time but bear with me for now and happy holidays!
