    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Faith Changes</h1>
    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      Lately I’ve been musing on alot of things. I'm consciously trying to avoid
      the words 'struggling with’ because these things make me realize areas I
      need to grow in. One big thing on my mind is staying true and grounded to
      my faith. As I grow older, I’ve realized that I had been taking a lot of
      important things for granted, and I’ve been working on being the grown
      adult I want myself to be, by being intentional about my financial,
      career, education, and life after-35 goals. These seem to be taking shape,
      but I’m struggling with actually staying grounded to my faith goals. I am
      on the lukewarm side and I detest it.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I was 15 or 16, someone (who I still can’t remember no matter how
      hard I try) once told me, as you grow older, it becomes even harder than
      you think to create time to grow within your faith. And I never showed it,
      but deep down I scoffed—a gentle scoff, of course. Because when I was
      young, things like praying, casual conversing with God, and even jisting
      were effortless. It felt like an ordinary thing, and I had thought surely
      the relationship will grow and become better as time passed. But now, as I
      sit and think of how I long for those days, I know that person was right.
      <br />
      <br />I still try to create time for God, but there’s that spiritual
      connection that is missing, and I know why it’s missing because it was
      never about the conversations or the prayers; it was about the habits that
      kept Him close. I realized that in the past, there were no distracting
      habits, just struggling to get that perfect grade, having
      good times with friends, and that
      was it. Nothing ever crossed me to the level of losing my temper and
      crying out angrily. Point is,
      there are more things that are now proving hard to navigate and with more
      of this I feel farthest from His presence. To keep my sanity, I’ve taken
      some time away from their casual conversations (maybe I’m
      delusional but yes they were conversations) to help me deal with the
      constant trials.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the past, the gentle inner voice which I had come to recognize
      distinctively, would guide me through every emotion, every action. But
      somehow, that connection has slipped away. I pray to revive it, and I know
      the how-to, but it's not happening. I fully know it is in the habits I’ve
      picked up gradually that are pushing Him away. But those very habits are
      my coping mechanisms. So, the question is—how do I learn to let them go?

    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <p>
        When I started working in Developer Relations (DevRel), I didn't know
        much about Developer Experience (DX). In fact, I wasn't familiar with
        many DevRel terms. I learned most of it on the job, gradually
        understanding the different parts of DevRel: Developer Advocacy,
        Developer Marketing, Developer Success, and Developer Experience. At
        first, I struggled to cover all these areas to meet my job goals. DevRel
        works best with a team, and doing it all alone can be tough. But over
        time, I learned more and got better at handling my tasks. While building
        a community is important in DevRel, and it feels like I should have
        started by writing on it, I've been focusing more on Developer
        Experience lately and so I felt more compelled to write about it. If
        you're interested in learning about DX, then this blog is for you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-black">
          <strong>What is Developer Experience</strong>
        </h1>
        Developer Experience (DX) is about how developers interact with and feel
        about tools, APIs, or software. It's similar to User Experience (UX),
        but for developers. Good DX means the tools are easy to use and
        enjoyable, while bad DX can be frustrating and inefficient. People in
        DevRel teams work to make the developer experience positive and
        productive.

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-black">
        <strong>How DevRels Improve Developer Experience</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>
        DevRel professionals bridge the gap between organizations and the
        developer community. While focusing on DX their responsibilities include
        but is not limited to updating documentation, creating educational
        materials and maintaining open-source projects (for companies with open
        source projects.)
        <br />
        <br /> Here’s a closer look at how they achieve this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Keeping Documentation Up-to-Date:</strong> This means
          regularly updating API documentation to show new features and
          improvements. Good documentation helps developers understand how to
          use the tools and stay informed about changes.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          <strong>Creating Learning Materials:</strong> They create various
          learning materials, like guides, video tutorials, and sample projects.
          These resources help developers learn how to use tools more easily.
          For example, step-by-step guides quickly show developers how to use an
          API in their projects.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Engaging with the Community:</strong> Engaging with the
          developer community is crucial and can happen through forums, social
          media, and events. Hosting webinars, joining discussions, and
          gathering feedback, help DevRel professionals to address developers'
          challenges and improve resources in turn increasing DX.

          Improving DX in Chimoney’s API Documentation and Resources
        </h1>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I mentioned earlier, I have been focusing on Developer Experience
        of late and one of my most rewarding experiences has been improving DX
        for Chimoney's API Documentation and Community projects (I'll reference
        last year's efforts). <br />
        <br />
        Here’s how I'm doing it:
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Enhancing Documentation:</strong>This has been a slow but
          rewarding process. I started by thoroughly reviewing our documentation
          and studying documentation from other products. I needed all the
          insights I could get to understand what makes documentation truly
          effective. Through the events we've been having in our community and
          others I attended to talk about our open-source project, I gradually
          gathered a lot of feedback. With these feedback, I worked on the first
          iteration of the documentation update which turned out well. I
          simplified the getting started guide, ensuring that all necessary
          information was easily accessible. I also updated the glossary,
          provided clear explanations for the endpoints, introduced a changelog,
          and identified and got bugs fixed in some endpoints. These
          improvements allowed developers to find the information they needed
          quickly and easily, leading to a smoother experience.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developing Learning Materials: </strong>
          This is what I am currently working on, and it honestly requires a lot
          of patience. I had started by creating a{" "}
          <a
            href="https://chimoney.io/api-use-cases/"
            className="text-blue-500 underline"
          >
            use case page{" "}
          </a>{" "}
          that includes step-by-step integration guides to help developers
          quickly understand how to incorporate Chimoney's APIs into their
          projects using real-world examples. Currently, I am developing
          integration guides for all of our endpoints and initially
          overestimated how quickly I could complete all the content, including
          written tutorials and videos. The goal is to create a variety of
          learning materials tailored to different learning styles. These
          resources help shorten the process of understanding how exactly the
          endpoints work and how to integrate them which all ties back to
          developer experience and shortening integration times.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active Community Engagement:</strong> For this I'll reference
          last year's participation in our open source project. Events, office
          hours or just setting up a specific channel for support as developers
          integrate is very crucial. What works for me is setting up office
          hours and having one on ones when I am available to debug or solve
          issues our community contributors are facing while integrating. These
          help me get first hand feedback to continuously improve our tools and
          documentation.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encouraging Contributions:</strong> Developers most times feel
          better contributing to projects that have a collaborative environment.
          For this we ensure to provide clear guidelines for contributing to our
          open-source projects. We also make sure to be responsive to pull
          requests and issues, creating a welcoming atmosphere for new
          contributors. This has helped to improve our projects and build a
          stronger, more supportive community because of the good developer
          experience in terms of support.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        I am still learning on how to constantly improve DX in our documentation
        and resources and so this blog might not be as informative as I would
        like it to be but I will constantly update it as I work on more details
        and resources. Feel free to reach out and ask questions or give
        feedback.

    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Empowering Financial Communities through Open-Source Readiness</h1>
    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <p>
As someone involved in community building and developer relations, I’ve seen the amazing impact of 
open source on financial ecosystems. While I never got to present my talk at the  <a
            href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum-london/"
            className="text-blue-500 underline"
          >
            Open Source Finance Forum,{" "}
          </a> 
I still wanted to share my thoughts on how open-source readiness can empower financial communities, 
gathering from my experience at Chimoney.<br/><br/>
<strong>Understanding Open Source Readiness</strong><br/>
When I talk about open-source readiness, I’m referring to more than just the ability to use open-source 
software. It’s about creating a mindset and a culture that embraces collaboration, transparency, and 
innovation. Open source is a philosophy that, when properly understood and adopted, can create significant 
potential for any community—especially in the finance sector.
At Chimoney, while we haven't built major features from the ground up using open source, we actively 
leverage open-source projects and tools developed by the community. For instance, we leverage SDKs and tools 
developed by open-source contributors, which enable us to streamline processes like rewarding contributors 
directly through Chimoney wallets on GitHub.<br/><br/>
<strong>How Open Source Transforms Financial Ecosystems</strong><br/>
The traditional financial industry has often been closed off, with proprietary systems and limited 
collaboration. But I’m seeing firsthand how open-source projects are changing that landscape. By opening up 
development and inviting collaboration, these projects are creating more inclusive, flexible, and innovative 
financial systems.
At Chimoney, we’ve used the power of open source to improve our platform’s capabilities. In particular, our 
integration with Interledger (a global open protocol for payments) has allowed us to contribute to and benefit 
from a network of innovators working towards making financial transactions more accessible whilst staying true to our mission of financial inclusion.
<br/><br/><strong>Open Source in Driving Financial Inclusion</strong><br/>
I honestly believe that open-source technologies play a part in achieving financial inclusion. In many parts of the world, access to financial services is still limited, and traditional systems often fail to reach the people who need them most. But open source can change that by providing the tools and platforms needed to build inclusive financial systems.
At Chimoney, our focus on open-source readiness has enabled us to create solutions that cater to a wide range 
of users. We're currently improving features like our multi-currency wallets and cross-border payment services 
by integrating with Interledger’s open-source Rafiki API, making these services accessible to everyone, 
regardless of location or economic status. By leveraging open-source technologies, we can ensure that our services are not only innovative but also inclusive and equitable.
<br/><br/><strong>Practical Ways for Embracing Open Source Readiness</strong><br/>
Here are a few strategies that I think can help others embrace open-source readiness in their 
financial communities:<br/><br/>
<strong>1. Education First:</strong> It’s important to educate your team and community about what open source 
means and how it can benefit them. Knowing the core ideas behind open source is key to success.<br/><br/>
<strong>2. Active Collaboration:</strong> Engage with existing open-source communities and contribute to 
projects that align with your goals. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of what makes open source so 
powerful.<br/><br/>
<strong>3. Invest in the Right Infrastructure:</strong> Make sure your technical infrastructure is capable of 
supporting open-source tools. This not only includes the software stack but also creating an environment that 
encourages continuous learning and improvement.<br/><br/>
<strong>4. Encourage Creativity:</strong> Allow your team the freedom to experiment with open-source tools and
 ideas. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, so it’s important to create an environment where 
 creativity is encouraged.<br/><br/>
<strong>5. Focus on Inclusion:</strong> Always keep the needs of underrepresented and underserved communities 
in mind when developing open-source solutions. Financial inclusion should be a priority in any open-source 
project in the financial sector.<br/><br/>
I hope this blog inspires you to consider how you can include open-source readiness in your own work—either as a developer, community manager, or someone involved in the financial sector in any capacity.
<br/><br/>
Until next time!

    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is the Cost of Education for a Samburu Girl?
    </h1>
    <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
    In Samburu, the price of education is not just measured in tuition fees or school supplies, 
    it’s weighed against a girl’s freedom, future, and sometimes, life. Here, many girls face 
    the cruel reality of female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages, often as young 
    as eight years old. These deeply ingrained practices rob them of the opportunity to learn,
    dream, and choose their paths. In a region where the teenage pregnancy rate is at 50%—the
    highest in Kenya—the odds are stacked against these girls from an early age, with many 
    forced into motherhood before they even understand what it means to be a child.
    <br/>
    Today, we are at the Samburu Girls Foundation, a sanctuary built to rescue these young 
    girls from the cruel traditions that bind them. This foundation is where these girls are
    given a second chance. From the moment they arrive, they are nurtured, empowered, and 
    given the opportunity to pursue their education all the way to university.
    <br/>    <br/>

    <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />    <br/>
    We had the privilege of meeting Dr. Josephine Kulea, the founder of the Samburu Girls Foundation, 
    a week before our visit. Her calm and gentle demeanor contradicted the incredible strength and 
    resolve she carries within her—a powerhouse, we soon learned, through the stories she shared.
    <br/><br/>
    Josephine’s journey to founding the Samburu Girls Foundation began with a deeply personal moment. 
    <i>“I was invited to a wedding,”</i> she recounts. <i>“I didn’t know who the bride was until I was told it 
    was my cousin, who I thought was still in school.”</i> The bride, was only ten years old, and Josephine
    was horrified. A day before the wedding, she took her cousin and went straight to the police station.
    That was the first girl she rescued. 
    <br/><br/>
    But Josephine’s relief was short-lived. <i>“The wedding still went on,”</i> she tells us, <i>“They replaced her 
    with her younger sister, who was only seven.”</i> Shocked and angered by the reality of what had happened, 
    Josephine returned and rescued the younger girl too. The first girl got remarried later on but her younger
     sister remained under Josephine’s care, and she was the catalyst for what would later become the Samburu 
     Girls Foundation.
     <br/><br/>
    
     Listening to her recount these early days of her mission, we couldn’t help but wonder what kind of 
     courage it took to stand up against deeply fixed traditions, to face resistance not just from the 
     community, but even from her own family. <i>“I received curses from my family,”</i> she admits, <i>“and there
    were times my life was in danger, but I didn’t care. All I wanted was for these girls to have the 
    chance to go to school because I strongly believe in education.”</i>
    <br/>

    Josephine's commitment has changed the lives of thousands of girls. At the foundation, we met the 
    second girl Josephine rescued. Now grown, she was beautiful, a graduate, and a living proof of the 
    impact Josephine’s work had on the girls' lives.
    <br/><br/>
    <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />   
    <br/>
    In the meetings we’d had virtually before the visit, we’d interacted with Wanjiru, the foundation’s 
    current executive director, and when we finally met her we immediately felt the warmth and kindness 
    that she radiates. 
    <br/><br/>
    <i>“I met Josephine by chance,”</i> Wanjiru tells us, <i>“and when she shared her story with me, I was 
      intrigued.”</i> 
    She visited the foundation a short time later and, upon returning to Nairobi, made a life-altering decision.
     <i>“I gave my one-month notice at work, packed up my things, and moved to Samburu to help Josephine,”</i> 
     she recalls, smiling. <i>“Even Josephine couldn’t believe it.”</i> We couldn’t believe it too.
     <br/><br/>
     Over the years, she and Josephine have worked side by side, overcoming many challenges.
     <i>“When we started, we had no land,”.</i> Today, the foundation sits on 15 acres of land.
    <br/><br/>
    Even with the foundation’s successes, it has never been easy. Wanjiru shares stories of the resistance 
    they’ve faced from the community, particularly from the older women who questioned why they were challenging
     practices that had been the norm for generations. There were times when morans—young Samburu men—would 
     break into the school to try and reclaim their ‘wives,’ and Wanjiru recalls how they had to install 
     electric fences to keep them out. <i>“Guns aren’t a big deal here,”</i> she says.
     <br/><br/>
     <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />
     <br/>   


     As we sat in one of the foundation’s classrooms—doubling as an ICT room—Wanjiru shared more about the 
     struggles they faced in keeping the foundation running. <i>“It’s hard to get donations or consistent 
      funding,”</i>
    Wanjiru admits. <i>“I’ve had to learn how to be a professional beggar.”</i>  We laugh at the joke, but the 
    reality is sobering.
    <br/><br/>
    It was in the room that Wanjiru introduced us to Angella, a bright young girl who had been accepted 
    into Kenyatta University but hadn’t been able to start due to financial challenges. <i>“But she will join,”  
      </i>  Wanjiru says with her usual positivity. <i>“It might take some time, but she will join. Who knows, maybe 
    she’ll get a scholarship like Rozilla.”</i> 
    <br/><br/>Rozilla, another success story from the foundation, had recently
    been awarded a Mastercard Foundation scholarship to study International Relations at USIU. Rozilla had
    been part of the Technovation Challenge and their team had won the  <a
            href="https://nation-africa.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/samburu-girls-win-global-tech-competition-3918876"
            className="text-blue-500 underline"
          >
            global competition in 2022.
          </a>
    <br/><br/>
          <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />    <br/>
    We ask how the girls come to the foundation, and Wanjiru explains <i>"Some come running, some walk for days,
     and others are brought by rescuers from the community."</i> Once they arrive, the foundation begins the 
     delicate process of verifying where the girl comes from, often by calling local chiefs and community 
     leaders. As much as they prioritize the girl’s education and safety, Wanjiru emphasizes, <i>"We believe 
     family connection is important."</i> They always strive to reconcile the girls with their families, no 
     matter how complicated the situation may be.
    <br/><br/>
    This is not always simple. Some families resist, and in more complicated cases, the foundation 
    finds itself in legal battles. Wanjiru shares that some of the girls' families have sued the foundation 
    because they were paid bride prices, and the families are now being asked to return the livestock. "For 
    the Samburu community, wealth is in their animals," she says, explaining why negotiations with the families 
    can become heated. Despite these challenges, the foundation is not alone in its efforts. Wanjiru mentions 
    they have a support network, including the directorate of Children services, and pro bono counselling firms,
    <i>"Somehow, we manage,"</i> she adds.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    When the girls first come to the center, they’re placed into what Wanjiru calls a "one-year accelerator 
    program." She laughs softly as she says, <i>"It started as a joke."</i> Most of the girls had never been to school
     before, and simply enrolling them in a local school would be overwhelming for many. So, the accelerator 
     program was created to teach them the basics—reading, writing, and math—before placing them into primary 
     schools nearby. Wanjiru mentions a key detail: they make sure the girls attend schools outside Samburu 
     County. <i>"We want them to mix with other girls from different places, to give them exposure,"</i> she explains.
     Many of these girls have never been beyond Samburu, and this exposure is important.
   <br/><br/>  <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />     <br/>
    As we walked around, Wanjiru pointed out the small room where she and Josephine used to sleep, and the 
    office they worked from, a reminder of how far they had come. We passed the kitchen, a simple wooden 
    structure where all the girls' meals were prepared, but they would soon be closing it down and moving 
    to a better kitchen.
    <br/><br/>
    The foundation has a basketball pitch—a state-of-the-art court. The court was a gift from Masai Ujiri, 
    built after a visit to the foundation. <i>“He asked the girls what they wanted,”</i> Wanjiru recalled, smiling, 
    “and they said, <i>‘We want to play basketball!’</i>  So, he built them a court.”
    <br/><br/>
    <hr className="border-2 border-gray-300" />    
    <br/>
    After the tour, we meet the girls. At first glance, they’re beautiful and full of life, and it’s almost 
    impossible to imagine the trauma they endured before arriving at the foundation. 
    <br/><br/>
    Wanjiru, asks them to sing the SGF anthem and as they sing the anthem reminds us why they are here, why they love this 
    place, and why they will forever be grateful for the work being done. It’s an emotional moment.

    We introduce ourselves, and the girls’ curiosity is boundless as they ask lots of questions, only stopping 
    when Wanjiru gently intervenes. As we leave, it's clear that the foundation is giving these girls safety, 
    education, and hope. But there’s also a heaviness in knowing how many more girls need this kind of refuge. 
    Wanjiru had mentioned earlier how hard it is to find donors, and how they struggle to support as many girls
     as they wish due to limited resources—healthcare, food, and even basic expenses are stretched thin. The foundation needs support to help more girls because the work they do is nothing short of extraordinary,
     and the lives they save are worth every sacrifice.
